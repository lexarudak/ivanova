      " This modern district development in the city center offers a new level of urban living. Comprised of residential complexes, each consisting of 4-5 multistory buildings of varying heights, the area was designed to provide a modern and upscale aesthetic while ensuring cost-effectiveness. This was achieved by raising the level of detail closer to the viewer, reducing construction costs and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the development",
      "As part of the architect team, I found the experience of conceptualizing and executing this residential development to be a valuable learning opportunity. From designing each building to delivering the project to the client, I was able to demonstrate my ability to work as part of a team and showcase my skills in designing modern residential developments.",

      "In this project, I served as both customer and designer for my own apartment, striving to make the most of a small area. I utilized the high ceiling of 3.3 meters to create a multi-level space, with key changes such as relocating the bathroom door from the entrance to the living room, combining the balcony door and window, and incorporating my love for second-tier spaces by placing the bed at a height of 2 meters.",
      'Instead of a traditional sofa, I used a podium that provided extra storage and a comfortable "nest." The work area was integrated with the dining table, and a "support cube" was added to contain a pantry and free up space in the bathroom. One wall of the bathroom was also made with glass blocks to enhance natural light and visually enlarge the space.',
      "My goal for the aesthetic was to use simple forms that interact to create a cohesive, multi-level space. The final outcome met my expectations, exceeding my vision and showcasing my ability to design a functional and aesthetically pleasing space in a small area ",

      "In this project, I joined mid-progress and was tasked with transferring the model from ArchiCAD to Revit.

      "I got to work on a cool project where I designed the floor plans and exterior of a big private house in Central Asia. It was a new experience for me since it was my first time designing the outside of a house that size.The client was from a different country with different customs and culture, so it was a bit of a challenge to make sure we included those traditional elements while still keeping it modern.For example, the client had specific ideas about where certain rooms should go, like bedrooms and staff quarters, based on local customs.Overall, it was a great learning experience. I got to improve my design skills and learn more about different cultures.",
