      " This modern district development in the city center offers a new level of urban living. Comprised of residential complexes, each consisting of 4-5 multistory buildings of varying heights, the area was designed to provide a modern and upscale aesthetic while ensuring cost-effectiveness. This was achieved by raising the level of detail closer to the viewer, reducing construction costs and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the development",
      "As part of the architect team, I found the experience of conceptualizing and executing this residential development to be a valuable learning opportunity. From designing each building to delivering the project to the client, I was able to demonstrate my ability to work as part of a team and showcase my skills in designing modern residential developments.",

      "In this project, I served as both customer and designer for my own apartment, striving to make the most of a small area. I utilized the high ceiling of 3.3 meters to create a multi-level space, with key changes such as relocating the bathroom door from the entrance to the living room, combining the balcony door and window, and incorporating my love for second-tier spaces by placing the bed at a height of 2 meters.",
      'Instead of a traditional sofa, I used a podium that provided extra storage and a comfortable "nest." The work area was integrated with the dining table, and a "support cube" was added to contain a pantry and free up space in the bathroom. One wall of the bathroom was also made with glass blocks to enhance natural light and visually enlarge the space.',
      "My goal for the aesthetic was to use simple forms that interact to create a cohesive, multi-level space. The final outcome met my expectations, exceeding my vision and showcasing my ability to design a functional and aesthetically pleasing space in a small area ",

      "I got to work on a cool project where I designed the floor plans and exterior of a big private house in Central Asia. It was a new experience for me since it was my first time designing the outside of a house that size.The client was from a different country with different customs and culture, so it was a bit of a challenge to make sure we included those traditional elements while still keeping it modern.For example, the client had specific ideas about where certain rooms should go, like bedrooms and staff quarters, based on local customs.Overall, it was a great learning experience. I got to improve my design skills and learn more about different cultures.",

      "The Lebiajy project was a renovation of an apartment in Minsk, Belarus with the goal of creating an open and well-lit space. The challenge was integrating the entrance into the common space while ensuring ample natural light. The design used similar-form windows and functional decor elements to achieve this. The redesign improved the space's functionality and created a cozy, welllit environment for the family. Wooden surfaces added warmth to the atmosphere.",
      "From a personal standpoint, this project showcased my design skills and understanding of functional and aesthetic principles. My focus was on creating a modern and warm space while incorporating functional elements. I am proud to include the Lebiajy project in my portfolio as it demonstrates my ability to balance form and function, and showcases my design skills. The simple and elegant design, combined with the successful integration of natural light, makes this project stand out in my portfolio.",

We wanted to communicate a sense of purpose through the design, so we took inspiration from primitive times to create an atmosphere reminiscent of a cave.",
      "The walls were adorned with murals depicting rough stone, while a fireplace area added a cozy contrast to the technological metal structures that served a practical purpose. The design was a collaboration between myself and the performers, as every element, from the large-format stone to the artificial animal skins, required close attention and careful selection.",
      "  The result was a space that was both visually striking and functional, with every element serving a specific purpose in creating the desired atmosphere. It was a challenge to balance these elements, but the final outcome was a success, and I am proud to include this project in my portfolio.",

I combined my experience, knowledge and adapted graphic design to best suit the project. 3D circuits were used to clarify complex elements and ensure accurate representation of the sequence of execution and final result. The Construction Administration phase allowed me to observe workers' interpretation and make adjustments. The project was a valuable learning experience that improved my skills and knowledge as an architect.",

      "Designing Nina's room was similar to designing Kate's room, with a focus on maintaining the established principle of space organization. This interior stood out to me as it had a strong, well-defined image of a little girl's room filled with 'unicorns'. It was a reminder that finding the right solution for each customer is possible by taking into account their undefined wishes and being mindful of the emotional aspect of the space.
